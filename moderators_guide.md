# Moderator's Guide

## Objectives
- Admin Team Motto: "Tolerance By Default". We assume the best in people but act swiftly when it is clear that there is a problem.
- We need to be consistent with our moderation of the group to avoid conflict that arises when member's are treated differently.

## Onboarding Guidance
- If a new member request has accepted the group rules and answered all the onboarding questions, the request will be automatically accepted.
- If a new member request has not accepted the group rules, it will automatically be declined normally within 1 hour by Facebook Admin Assist.
- If a new member request has accepted the group rules, but has not answered all the onboarding questions (currently there are 3), the request will be referred for moderation.
