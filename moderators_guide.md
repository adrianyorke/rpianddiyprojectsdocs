# Moderator's Guide

## Objectives
- Admin Team Motto: "Tolerance By Default". We assume the best in people but act swiftly when it is clear that there is a problem.
- We need to be consistent with our moderation of the group to avoid conflict that arises when member's are treated differently.

## Onboarding Guidance
- If a new member request has accepted the group rules and answered all the onboarding questions, the request will be automatically accepted by Facebook Admin Assist.
- If a new member request has not accepted the group rules, it will automatically be declined by Facebook Admin Assist (normally within 1 hour).
- If a new member request has accepted the group rules, but has not answered all the onboarding questions (currently there are 3), the request will be declined by Facebook Admin Assist (normally within 1 hour).
> Note: Facebook Admin Assist sometimes goes offline. When this happens, manual moderation is required to clear the backlog of requests that would normally have been declined automatically.

## How to handle member conflict and bullying
- In general, this group is a safe and friendly place.
- We have both younger members and older members who need different levels of support and protection.
- We do not tolerate bullying or aggression and move quickly to suspend or ban members if the case is extreme.

## When and how do we permanently ban members?
- If we suspect that a member is a spammer or "zombie" account, we move quickly and permanently ban the member.
- When we ban a member, we should also delete all posting history in the group to clear out all other posts/comments that may not have been discovered.
